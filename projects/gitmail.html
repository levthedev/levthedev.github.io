      <span id="date">July 13th, 2015</span>
      <p><a href="http://github.com/levthedev/GitMail">GitMail</a> is a small Ruby project that gets you a list of contributors' emails from a Git repository. I made it a couple years ago and never released it, and when I did, it recoeved some discussion on <a href="">HackerNews</a>, where it reached the front page. It also has a little over 100 stars on GitHub (where it is currently my most starred project) and is the first project I ever worked on where I recieved a Pull Request from a stranger, which was a delightful feeling.</p>
      <p>You can check out the GitHub repository for it <a href="https://github.com/levthedev/GitMail">here</a>.</p>
