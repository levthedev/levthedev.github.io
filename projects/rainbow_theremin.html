      <h1>Rainbow Theremin</h1>
      <span id="date">March 25th, 2016</span>
      <p><a href="http://github.com/levthedev/rainbow_theremin">Rainbow Theremin</a> is a project that tracks any <span style="color:magenta">magenta</span> colored object with the user's webcam for X/Y/X coordinates, and then converts those X/Y/Z coordinates into a Theremin’s amplitude and frequency (as well as a paintbrush's size and color). If you’ve played around with it a bit, you might have noticed the fatal flaw in this idea - painting a beautiful picture makes terrible theremin music, and making good theremin music makes for horrible paintings. Even so, this is a fun little toy that I thought I’d share. I wrote it while doing a fellowship at <a href="https://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a> with Node, Express, and p5.js, a Javascript Processing library.</p>
      <p>You can check out the GitHub repository for it <a href="https://github.com/levthedev/rainbow_theremin">here</a>, and you can see a live demo of it <a href="colorsynth.herokuapp.com">here</a> - note that it requires a webcam and likely will not work on older browsers or on mobile.</p>
