      <h1>2017 - Goals</h1>
      <span id="date">January 15th, 2017</span>
      <h2>Why make goals?</h2>
      I'm writing these goals down to serve as a reminder for me about what I want to focus on this year. They also will provide useful information at the end of the year when I write another Year In Review post, like the one I wrote for <a href="./2016_in_review.html">2016</a>. Lastly, putting this out on the internet provides at least some form of accountability to actually try to achieve these goals.

      <h2>Basic Goals</h2>
      In 2017, my basic goals are:
      <ul>
        <li>Make $500/month from an MVP/Startup/Side Project</li>
        <li>Go to the gym 3 times a week to run, lift weights, and do yoga</li>
        <li>Cook more food at home and eat less processed food</li>
        <li>Spend less than $1300/month ($650 rent, $100 utilities, $300 food, $250 entertainment, $100 student loans, $100 incidentals)</li>
        <li>Write more - blog posts (1/week), fiction, poetry, code.</li>
        <li>Read 2 books per month</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
      In 2017, my stretch goals are:
      <ul>
        <li>Make $1000/month (ramen profitable!) from an MVP/Startup/Side Project</li>
        <li>Go to the gym 5 times a week to run, lift weights, and do yoga</li>
        <li>Get a project into a major tech publication (Wired, TechCrunch, Forbes, etc)</li>
        <li>Read 4 books per month</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>12 in 12</h2>
      This year, I'm going to try to create 12 MVP's in 12 months. Inspiration from this comes from <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/12-startups-in-12-months-how-this-digital-nomad-doing-it">Pieter Levels</a>, <a href="https://indiehackers.com">IndieHackers</a> and "micro-entrepreneurs", like <a href="https://blog.apex.sh/announcing-apex-software-inc-5008c454002#.x7n9arkgd">TJ Holowaychuck</a> and <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick McKenzie</a>. I'll be launching the first MVP at the end of the month, and doing a retrospective blog post on the launch and what went right/wrong. If any of these projects "take off" (meaning either solid growth or solid revenue), I'll take a break from the 12 projects in 12 months idea to focus full time on scaling up the successful project.

      That's all, folks!
